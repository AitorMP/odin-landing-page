          <p>
            Fenrir is the great wolf in Norse Mythology who breaks free from his
            chains at Ragnarök, the twilight of the gods, kills Odin, and is
            then killed by Odin's son Vidarr. Fenrir is the son of the trickster
            god Loki and brother of the World Serpent Jormungandr and the jotunn
            Hel
            <br />
            <br />
            Fenrir, also known as Hróðvitnir (fame-wolf), is a Wolf-Giant-god
            and considered as one of the greatest enemies of the Aesir.

              In Norse mythology , Fenrir represents savagery that ultimately
              cannot be controlled, even by the gods.

          Fenrir, the great wolf, will free himself from his shackles. His mouth
          will gape: his upper jaw will reach the heavens, the lower jaw will
          touch the earth. There is nothing he cannot eat, nothing he will not
          destroy. Flames come from his eyes and his nostrils.
